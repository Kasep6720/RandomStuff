IAE A3
1. Can you explain the main objective or thesis of your essay?
The main objective of my essay is to state out and explain the roles of social media for public opinions. For me it sounds confusing at first, but eventually I understand the task and it isn’t so hard actually. As long as I still use social media, I can explain the roles of social media according to what I’ve seen in social medias. Well social media platforms influence various aspects of society, including communication, relationships, information dissemination, and social movements. In my essay, I focus more on how social media promotes social responsibility, allowing more interactions between political campaigns and the problem of spreading misinformation. According to my understanding and some researches, people can receive first hand information faster than others traditional medias, which makes them feel more engaged in social events and promotes their social responsibility. Besides,through social media, campaigns can post updates and respond to questions from the public in real time. Making it feel more open and easier to access, allowing more interaction between political campaigns and the public. However, social media can only be an alternative way to obtain public opinions. Since social media may contain misinformation, social media cannot be the only source of public opinions. And that’s the main objective of my essay.

2. Did you understand the assignment’s requirements before beginning your research?
Yes, I understand the assignment’s requirements before beginning my research. I began by looking at the assignment guidelines and objectives. Identifying the key topics and specific questions that needed to be addressed. Also to made sure any particular formats or styles that were required and the deadlines that were set. Throughout the research process, I keep checking back to the assignment criteria to ensure that I was not off topic. I also made notes of any insights or important information that aligned with the assignment's goals. In conclusion, I made it a priority to fully match the requirements before doing my research. This not only guided my work but also helped me to write a more focused and relevant essay. That’s all.

3. Did you allocate sufficient time for your research?
Yes. Before beginning my research, I made an educated guess to determine how much time I would need to finish the essay. Before that, I’ve already gathered enough relevant information in my free time. There is sufficient time for each stage of the essay writing progress. Initially, I also scheduled time for reading and summarizing key findings, so that I could synthesize the information effectively. Moreover, some of the researched leads to new questions, and I wanted to ensure I had the flexibility to explore these avenues without feeling rushed. Which I allocated some extra time for this part. Overall, I believe that the time I allocated for my research was sufficient to produce a good essay. (But to be honest since I was sick at that time I missed the deadline that day and after writing the email to explain the situation, I just had the “it is what it is” mindset and spend the rest of the day to improve my essay so just in case I get that downgrade penalty the marks for the essay still might not be that bad.)

4. How did your understanding of time management improve during this course?
During this course, my understanding of time management significantly improved. Initially, I struggled with balancing multiple assignments and deadlines, often being a deadline fighter. However, as the course progressed, I learned the importance of planning and prioritization. One key strategy I learned is to break larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks. This approach not only made complicated assignments feel more achievable but also allowed me to track my progress more easily. I began setting specific, measurable goals for each session. For example, when writing my essay, I separate it into different parts, like data researching, planning, writing, organising and checking. I do each part in different periods so it won’t feel overwhelming to write the essay. Additionally, I started setting deadlines for myself. This helped create a sense of urgency and accountability, pushing me to stay on track. I made these strategies since I started to understand the importance of submitting assignments on time in college. In secondary school, submitting homework late won’t affect too much in my academic results. However in college, submitting assignments on time is essential for the academic results as the penalties are more serious and the assignments weights a higher proportion of my grade. This pushed me to focus more on being responsible and submitting my work on time.

5. What strategies did you learn for managing your study time effectively?
I learnt some strategies to manage my study time more effectively. One key strategy I learned is to break larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks. This approach not only made complicated assignments feel more achievable but also allowed me to track my progress more easily. I began setting specific, measurable goals for each session. For example, when writing my essay, I separate it into different parts, like data researching, planning, writing, organising and checking.

This helped create a sense of urgency and accountability, pushing me to stay on track. Or just simply try my best to make progress in my work in my free time. These strategies gave me a greater sense of confidence to manage my time effectively.

6. Can you explain how you applied self-discipline in completing your assignments?
At the beginning, I was a deadline fighter and it just works at the start of the semester. However when the workload starts to increase, I realised that I can no longer be a deadline fighter for the rest of the semester. I started to understand the importance of being disciplined and submitting assignments on time in college. In secondary school, submitting homework late won’t affect too much in my academic results. However in college, submitting assignments on time is essential for the academic results as the penalties are more serious and the assignments weights a higher proportion of my grade. This pushed me to focus more on being responsible and submitting my work on time. To maintain self-discipline, I created a study schedule that allocated specific times for research and writing. I minimised distractions by using the students common room on the third floor since it’s a more suitable environment for me to study than my own room due to less distractions such as my laptop and my comfy bed. This focus allowed me to dive deeply into my assignments without interruptions. Additionally, I set deadlines for myself before the official due dates since I know that I definitely won’t have enough time to do my checking. This gives me time to review and improve my submissions. When I felt tempted to throw away everything and play, I reminded myself of the importance of meeting these self-imposed deadlines. That’s how I applied self discipline in completing my assignments.

7. What strategies did you develop to maintain motivation throughout the course?
I simply just break larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks. This approach not only made complicated assignments feel more achievable but also allowed me to track my progress more easily. I began setting specific, measurable goals for each session. For example, when writing my essay, I separate it into different parts, like data researching, planning, writing, organising and checking. I do each part in different periods so it won’t feel overwhelming to write the essay. Whenever I feel stressed at what I’m doing, as long as the deadline isn’t near and I still got time at that part of the work, I’ll do other things or relax instead so that I won’t lose motivation. Also to be honest whenever I feels bored during the lecture, I’ll do other stuff instead, but not for too long probably like only 5 minutes so that I can regain some energy to focus on the lecture. After all it’s better to exchange a small amount of time for more time to focus on the lecture instead of sitting through the entire lecture without focusing.

8. How did the course help you develop better study habits?
Well, during this course, my understanding of time management significantly improved. Initially, I struggled with balancing multiple assignments and deadlines, often being a deadline fighter. However, as the course progressed, I learned the importance of planning and prioritisation. I developed some habits to manage my study time more effectively. I learned is to break larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks. This approach not only made complicated assignments feel more achievable but also allowed me to track my progress more easily. I began setting specific, measurable goals for each session. For example, when writing my essay, I separate it into different parts, like data researching, planning, writing, organising and checking.

However in college, submitting assignments on time is essential for the academic results as the penalties are more serious and the assignments weights a higher proportion of my grade. This pushed me to focus more on being responsible and submitting my work on time.

9. How did learning about academic resources, such as libraries and databases, help you research?
Throughout this course, my understanding of academic resources, particularly libraries and databases, improved my research capabilities. Before this, I often relied on internet searches in which I just google the stuff and use the first website or text that pops up as source, which sometimes led to unreliable or irrelevant information. Learning how to use the academic libraries and online databases opened a whole new world of safe and reliable sources that are essential for quality research. One of the most valuable aspects was learning how to use specific databases like Google Scholar. This platform not only provides access to a wide range of journals and articles but also allow for advanced functions such as pre generated citation formats. Which helped me find the most relevant materials for my assignments and gives me an easier time on doing my assignments. Overall, gaining familiarity with these academic resources has made my research process more efficient and effective. I now feel more confident in my ability to find, evaluate, and utilize information for my assignments, compared to how I do my A1 when I first started. This affects my academic performance positively.

10. How did you use the CRAP test to evaluate the quality of your sources?
Before joining the course, I have no idea what is the CRAP test, I initially thought it’s some sort of joke that some senior form students made. Now I understand that CRAP stands for Currency, Relevance, Authority, and Purpose. And each of these criteria helped me ensure that the information I was using was reliable and appropriate for my assignments. For currency, I know that whether the information was up-to-date and relevant to my topic. Usually the latest research is crucial, especially in fields like science and technology. I made sure to look for sources published within the last few years. For relevance, I can know if the information was applicable and helpful for my assignment. This meant not just looking for general information, but ensuring that it directly contributed to my understanding of the topic. For authority, I considered the credentials of the authors. I checked their qualifications and expertise in the subject area. This helped me prioritize sources from professionals with good reputations, which added credibility to my research. Last, purpose, understanding the purpose helped me identify any potential biases. I often prioritised sources that presented information objectively rather than those that had a vested interest in a particular outcome. By applying the CRAP test, I was able to refine my research process and select sources that were not only credible but also enriching for my assignments. 

11. What did you learn about self-assessment and how it can improve your writing skills?
Throughout this course, I learned that self-assessment is a powerful tool for enhancing my writing skills. Initially, I’d never do any self assessment as all I cared was only to submit it. However, I quickly realized that my work kinda sucks and I need self-assessment to allow me to engage more critically with my work. Every time after completing an assignment, I took the time to evaluate my writing against the objectives and criteria provided. This involved asking myself questions like: Did I effectively convey my main ideas? Was my argument well-structured? How could I improve my word choice or clarity? This practice helped me identify specific areas for improvement, such as developing stronger thesis statements or providing more substantial evidence. By recognizing my weaknesses, I was able to set targeted goals for future assignments. In conclusion, self-assessment has taught me that writing is an ongoing process of growth. By regularly evaluating my work, I can refine my skills, develop a more critical sense, and ultimately become a more effective writer.

12. How did you apply feedback from your instructor to improve your writing?
Throughout the course, I learned the importance of feedback in enhancing my writing skills. When I received my A1 feedback, I found out that the rubrics and criteria was different from how teachers mark my papers in secondary school. I took quite a while to inspect the feedback and then I made some changes on how I work on my essay. Firstly, I focused on understanding the specific areas that needed improvement. In the feedback, it shows that my referencing part got a lower grade than other part. I took the time to revisit my work, and then check my referencing part for mistakes so that I can fix it in my A2. I also got some mistakes in organisation part like using informal words and phrases and therefore I avoided using those phrases in my A2. This process helped me identify patterns in my writing that needed to be addressed so that I can improve in my essay. Also, I continually reflected on the feedback I received even when I’m doing assignments from other courses. This self-reflection allowed me to track my progress and always remember mistakes that I’ve made and avoiding them. The process of writing and revising became a vital part of my development. In summary, applying to the feedback was crucial for my growth. It taught me to focus on specific areas of improvement and always revise my work after finishing. Through this experience, I’ve become a more confident and effective in writing essays.

13. How did you independently evaluate and identify areas for improvement in your writing?
Well, I developed a habit that involved several steps. First, I would write my drafts and evaluate it critically. This process helped me identify sections that needed more development or clarification. Next, I utilized a checklist based on the writing guidelines provided. These checklists included elements such as thesis statement and evidence support. By systematically going through these criteria, I could pinpoint specific areas for improvement. Additionally, I found it helpful to take breaks between writing and reviewing. This distance allowed me to approach my work with fresh eyes, making it easier to spot inconsistencies or awkward phrasing I might have missed initially. It also refreshes myself so I won’t feel overwhelmed. Finally, I reflected on past feedback from both classmates and lecturers. By considering previous critiques, I could track my progress and focus on recurring issues, such as word choice or sentence structure. Although most of the time we do that after submission, we can still learn from our mistakes and try to avoid them in future assignments. These self-evaluation strategies not only improved my writing but also makes me feel more confident in my ability to identify and address areas needing improvement, ultimately leading to more effective writing.

14. Explain your essay structure. How are the ideas interlinked between each section (introduction, body paragraphs and conclusion)?
In the essay, there are 3 structures, which are the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. In the introduction, I began with a hook to grab the reader's attention, followed by some background information on the topic. I then stated clearly that the aim of the essay is to examine the roles of social media to public opinions, presented my thesis statement, which outlines the main argument and sets the direction for the essay, making it clear what the reader can expect. In the body paragraphs, each paragraph starts with a clear topic sentence, ensuring that my objective is clear to readers. I provide evidence and examples in each paragraph, to enhance my claims and adds depth to my analysis. I also use some transition phrases help link ideas within and between paragraphs. For instance, I use phrases like “additionally” or “however” to show relationships between concepts. In the conclusion, I summarize the key points made in the body paragraphs without introducing new information. I restate the thesis with the evidence discussed earlier in the essay, reinforcing how the sections interconnect. Finally, I offer a closing thought, leaving the reader with a lasting impression. That’s how my ideas links between different structures in my essay.

15. How did understanding essay structure enhance your ability to organise your writing?
Well, understanding essay structure is crucial for effective writing. Since the essay consists of three main parts: the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion, and each section serves a distinct purpose. I need to understand their purpose to effectively organise my essay. First, the introduction sets the stage for the reader. It provides background information and clearly states my thesis, which is to examine the roles of social media to public opinions. Having a strong thesis helps me focus my writing and ensures that everything in the essay supports this central idea. Next, the body paragraphs are where I elaborate on my thesis. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea of that section. According to my knowledge and if I’m not wrong, it is important to ensure that each body paragraph links back to the thesis and transitions smoothly from one idea to the next. This makes it easier for readers to follow my argument. Finally, the conclusion should link up everything together. It restates the thesis and summarizes the key points made in the body paragraphs. As a strong conclusion not only reinforces my argument but also leaves the reader with something to ponder. Overall, understanding essay structure has enabled me to organize my thoughts, to present my ideas clearly and strengthen my writing. Understanding the structure has made the writing process more manageable and effective and I won’t need to spend hours to find out what I’m going to write next.

16. What steps did you take to create a strong thesis statement?
To develop a strong thesis statements sounds difficult and confusing to me at first since I have no idea how can I achieve it. But after researching for a while and asking some senior form students, I kinda figured it out. I started by identifying the main topic of my essay, for me which is to examine the roles of social media to public opinions. This allows me to focus on searching more relevant information from google scholar and reduce time spent on meaningless articles. Then I gathered some useful information and examine them to see if they matches the CRAP test and the requirements for my essay. And once I decided to use that article as a source in my essay, I’d briefly sketch out what I’m gonna write in the essay and find some useful information from the source. After all that, I just make a thesis statement according to the sources and what I’m going to discuss in the essay. Or simply just use the main topic as the thesis statement.

17. What techniques did you use to integrate evidence into your essays effectively?
I used several techniques to integrate evidence into my essay. First, I focused on selecting relevant evidence that directly supported my thesis. I make sure the article passes the CRAP test and is relevant to my thesis statement so that my essay won’t be off topic. Next, when writing my essay, I would first introduce the source to provide context, followed by an explanation of how it supports my argument and then explain further. This helps ensure that the evidence is not just dropped into the essay but is clearly connected to my analysis. I also employed transition phrases to smoothly connect my evidence to my points. Phrases like "This illustrates that..." or "According to someone someone someone..." helped guide the reader through my argument and reinforced the link between my claims and the evidence. But when I really can’t insert transition phrases smoothly, I’ll just put the evidence into the explanation part and add referencing afterwards. Additionally, I usually analyze the evidence after presenting it. I explained how it supported my argument, which strengthened my arguments. Lastly, I varied the types of evidence I used. By using sources with some real-life examples, I created a more compelling and persuasive argument. Even though my techniques are not ideal and definitely not perfect, it still did the job right.

18. What skills did you develop in crafting clear and focused topic sentences?
To craft some clear and focused topic sentence, the first step for me is to find a good source. Which passes the CRAP test and is relevant to the thesis statement. Next I evaluate the source and see which part of it is going to end up in my essay. Then I make up a topic sentence according to the source and check if they are related and can link up to the thesis statement. And finally after finishing explaining the source and analysing I check the topic sentence again to see if it focuses on the paragraph. Also I would try to use specific language and avoid vague phrases in topic sentences to make it more precise.

19. How did you approach outlining before writing your essays?
When I started writing my essays, I found that outlining helped me organize my thoughts clearly. First, I would read the assignment to understand the topic, requirements and brainstormed ideas related to the main topic. Next, I wrote down my thesis statement, which is the main point of my essay. After that, I created an outline by listing the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. For each body paragraph, I noted the main idea I wanted to discuss and the evidence I would use to support it. This way, I had a clear roadmap for my essay. Outlining made the writing process smoother and helped me stay focused on my main points. Overall, it improved my organization and made my essays more coherent.

20. What strategies did you use to ensure your essays were well-organised and coherent?

I learned to highlight important points, which helped me focus on relevant materials and engage with the material more deeply. Additionally, I learnt to summarise each text to find out its main ideas and arguments. This allowed me to identify the author’s purpose and evaluate the effectiveness of their arguments. I also began to consider factors that affected validity such as evidence presented and if there are any biases or assumptions. This  approach encouraged me to think critically about the content. Another strategy is to participate in discussions with classmates further sharpened my skills. Hearing different perspectives allowed me to see arguments from multiple angles and consider counterarguments. Overall, these strategies helped me develop a better understanding of analysing texts and strengthen my ability to analyze arguments critically.

22. How did learning about logical fallacies improve the quality of your arguments?
Learning about logical fallacies has really improved my arguments in several ways. 
First, I can now spot common fallacies, which helps me avoid making similar mistakes in my own writing. This has made my arguments clearer and more credible.

24. What did you learn about the importance of revising and editing your drafts?
I learned that revising and editing my drafts are essential parts of the writing process that greatly enhance the quality of my work.
First, revising allows me to look at my writing from a broader perspective. It helps me evaluate whether my ideas are clearly expressed and logically organized. During this stage, I can refine my arguments, strengthen my thesis, and ensure that my writing flows smoothly from one point to the next.
Editing focuses on the details. This includes correcting grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. It’s also the time to check for consistency in formatting and style. Paying attention to these elements increases the professionalism of my writing and makes it easier for readers to engage with my work.
